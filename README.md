# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

A password generator application that anyone can use to generate a random password which is determined by the length which can be set by the user.

The user can also turn on or off the following attributes:

- Uppercase characters
- Lowercase characters
- Numbers
- Special characters

### User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

### What did I Learn

A lot of learning took place here, as I've made a basic password generator before; but I wanted to play around with generating the password using char codes and making the UI more user friendly rather than using prompts.

Some of the other things I learned were:

- Using char codes to generate random characters
- Creating methods
- How to style ranges but I'm still struggling with adjusting them and cross browser compatibility
- Looping through attributes to test whether they've been turned on or off to determine whether a method will be used
- Updating inputs on a page if another input has been changed
- Copying the text content of elements on a page to the clipboard
